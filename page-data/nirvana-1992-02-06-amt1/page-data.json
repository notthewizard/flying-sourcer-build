Analog glitches are present throughout, some of which caused digital glitches on capture. While most of the video is in color, there are extended sections of black and white.","The outro of All Apologies cuts to a different source of this show, as my copy was missing this section. The other source seems to have better sound, but I could not make a successful capture of this entire tape, as it is extremely glitchy.
